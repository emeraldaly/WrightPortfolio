            <p>My journey into web development was kindled when I attended a Startup Weekend Conference in Washington, DC.</p>
            <p>
                At this conference several things were clear:
                <ol>
                    <li>Developers were a key member of the team</li>
                    <li>There was abundant funding (free food and corporate sponsors weren't as prevalent in the non-profit realm)</li>
                    <li>There weren't many women</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                After I left the conference, I decided I wanted to learn to program. I started to attend tech meetups like:
                <ul>
                    <li>Women who Tech</li>
                    <li>DC Rails Girls</li>
                    <li>DC Nightowls</li>
                </ul>
                I took classes like Java Programming, where I learned all about classes and methods. I signed up for tutorials, both low-threshold paid and unpaid. However, I felt I was merely grazing the surface. I started to research Boot Camps to learn more.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not working, I like to:
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Perform improv. My first Improv showcase from the Washington Improv Theater is below:</li>

                    <!--make one of the links bold using the strong tag-->

                    <!--have one link open the url in a new tab (use target)-->

                    <p>Based on the following original poem:The boy with the crown was in loveWith the mousey-eared beauty who wasabove him two gradesand thus out of his range;A fact he did truly begrudge.So crown boy hatched a quick planTo convince her that he was her man.He wrote mouse-face a poem,and then got her alone,and read it as loud as he...can.This plan was quite poorAs her ears were enor-mous. His voice blasted herOut the door.</p>Posted by <a href="#" role="button">Elizabeth Fritz</a> on Sunday, January 3, 2010</blockquote>

    <p>So... Hillary and I thought it would be fun to incorporate some of &quot;Stomp the Yard&quot; into a crazy techno tune and totally make a fool of ourselves - with the rest of the Resident Assistants - and perform it for all of the Frosh, and Fritzes.</p>Posted by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/stefanie.s.palmer.7">Stefanie &#039;Sten&#039; Palmer</a> on Friday, September 21, 2007</blockquote>
